## Vocabulary words in a hexagonal matrix. 

I've been wanting to create a word search game using a hexagonal matrix for years--this is a stab at progressing that intent to the next waypoint in its journey.

TODO:
- [ ] Matrix
- [ ] Rudimentary example list
- [ ] UI/IO
- [ ] Win/Lose system
- [ ] Hide algorithms
- [ ] ...what else?
